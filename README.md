# Description
It is a Flutter application to help bus drivers find the best route to pick up passengers, and for passengers to have contact with the bus that will be picked up

# How it works
There are two types of passengers:
 - Drivers
   - Invite passengers
   - Based on the stops, define the best route, or show the distance to the stopping point
 - Passengers
   - Participate in bus trips
   - You are fully aware of where the bus is and where it is going
